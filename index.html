                            In this final project, I build upon the pathtracer built over time in the CSE 168 class. The
                            pathtracer started as a humble raytracer with based Blinn Phong shading capabilities;
                            overtime, I've added more features to it finally culminating in the relativistic renderer.
                            The Black Hole that appears in the scene is a Schwarzschild black hole. This means the black
                            hole is non-rotating, static, and uncharged. The black hole is rendered by solving the
                            geodesic equations of motion for a photon in the Schwarzschild metric. For the sake of
                            simplicity, I also use natural units where c = G = 1. For a Schwarzschild black hole, by
                            setting the mass (M) to 0.5, the radius of the EH (event horizon) becomes 1. These
                            approximations keep the differential equations manageable.

                            <p>
                                The geodesic equations describe the motion of particles and light in curved spacetime.
                                For a Schwarzschild black hole, these equations are derived from the Schwarzschild
                                metric, which represents the spacetime geometry around a non-rotating, uncharged black
                                hole. The equation looks like this:
                            </p>
                            <div class="is-centered" style="width: 100%;"><img src="static/images/sm0.png"

                            <p>
                                To simplify this, I first work with polar coordinates. I then work from the plane of
                                reference of the photon/ray. This plane is described by the cross product of the
                                direction of the ray and the vector joining the origin of the ray and the center of the
                                black hole. A Schwarzschild black hole guarantees that the photon will necessarily only
                                traverse on this plane.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                In the above equation, n is vector describing the plane, A is the ray origin, B is the
                                singularity, and d is the direction vector of the ray.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                From this plane, I also derive the azimuthal angles which I later use for
                                reconstructing the ray in 3D space.
                            </p>

                                Skipping a few steps here; following our substitutions, the equation describing the
                                geodesic takes the form of newton's conservation of energy, and the final form the
                                equation is:

                                As you can clearly see, the extreme lensing causes many of the light rays to scatter in

                                The first implementation was to extend my raytracer to support Skyboxes. I chose to use
                                equirectangular skyboxes which takes a 2:1 sky image and maps it to a sphere at
                                infinity. When the rays exit to infinity, they're mapped to uv coords of the source
                                image from which I sample the pixel colors. <em style="opacity: 50%;">UV map generated

                                As it rotates around, you can see the seam at the end of the skybox. This is intended
                                and known and is usally fixed by choosing an image which is symmetric.

                            <h3>Milestone 2: Black Hole Renderer</h3>
                            <p>
                                In this milestone, I implemented the beginnings of the renderer. In this stage the
                                output was just the direction of the exiting photon. Although this cannot be used for
                                raytracing yet, I was able to combine this with the skybox implementation to get some
                                visualisations. The implementation details can be found in my source code. I had to use
                                the boost library's ODE solver. I used the Cash Karp RK54 solver to solve the geodesic
                                IVP. This creates a series of deviations for a given initial condition in polar
                                coordinates in the plane of the ray. As I mentioned earlier, I used the plane azimuthals
                                to the recover the final 3D exit direction for the ray. This gave the visual that you
                                saw at the top of the page and also this:

                            <p>
                                I recreated the exit ray directions using the same strategy for the planes. Now, I had a
                                function that acted as a black box: I give it any arbitrary ray, it gives me the exiting
                                ray. I created the following pipeline:
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Emit rays from camera source.</li>
                                <li>Apply the black box function to each ray. The singularity is always assumed to be at
                                    the center. For different sizes, we can simply apply the inverse transform to the
                                    rest of the objects in the scene.</li>
                                <li>With the final set of exit rays, perform pathtracing with Importance
                                    Sampling/Russian Roulette/NEE etc.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>
                                This strategy gave me the following final render images:

                            <h3>Why not Raymarching?</h3>
                            <p>My initial choice was to use raymarching to perform the raytracing. This would involve
                                solving the geodesic at every pre specified timestep and then querying the BVH for
                                intersections. The obvious and the most significant advantage of raymarching is the ease
                                of getting the signature accretion disk to appear. That being said, raymarching was
                                simply too computationally expensive to run on my machine. This is a CPU based
                                pathtracer, and I have an Apple Metal GPU accelerated pathtracer in the works but that's
                                just a personal project of mine adjacent to the CSE 168 class raytracer. Since the Metal
                                pipeline is relatively self contained with little adjustability, it would interfere with
                                the required implementations in the classwork. Therefore, I deemed the raymarcher to be
                                too expensive and I came up with a bunch of mathematical tricks to get something very
                                close to a fully raymarched solution.</p>
                            <h3>Future Work</h3>
                            <p>These are the things I will be expanding upon in the future (in no particular order):</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>GPU accelerated ray marching + accretion disk</li>
                                <li>Non static blackholes</li>
                                <li>Real Time rendering (p.s. this is extremely difficult even for the most basic
                                    blackholes)</li>
                            </ul>
